          <p class="margin-none-t text-big">
            The Sense project started with a post on Reddit where I offered to build a simple website for any price. I was curious what feedback I’d get, but more importantly I wanted real world experience building something for a real business.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got messages from a lot of hopeful business looking to take advantage of my offer. Eventually I narrowed this down to a single project. Sense.

          <h3 class="margin-none-b">Overview</h3>
          <p class="margin-none-t">
            Sense needed a way to easily showcase the service and engage users to try it out. A large portion of Sense's traffic is on mobile and we wanted to make sure the project would be designed with these mobile users in mind. The goal of the redesign was to increase conversions on all devices. We wanted to clearly explain the service and allow users to send a text easily.
          </p>
          <p class="text-big">
            <i>
              The first problem was to convince people to text. The second problem was making the transition from website to SMS an easy and friendly experience.
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Building an interactive chat animation allowed me kill two birds with one stone. This visual interaction captured the attention of new visitors and gave them a path to follow. Users knew exactly what to do to start using the service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mobile users were even given the option to directly open a text message and get a movie recommendation. They simply clicked a button and a text message was pre-populated for the them. <i>Try it out below</i>.

            <h4 class="margin-none-b">Sketching</h4>
            <p class="margin-none-t">
              The project started with a number of initial conversations with Jake Cohn (Founder of Sense). From here I was able to establish a much better idea of what the project needed. I gave Jake a solid schedule and followed up with rough sketches. From here I had a much better idea of where Jake wanted to take the Sense brand. With this information I was able to create an early colour palette.

            <h4 class="margin-none-b">Prototyping</h4>
            <p class="margin-none-t">
              Once sketching and brainstorming was complete I had a much better idea of the direction Jake wanted to take with this project. We were both happy with the early sketches and decided to move forward. From here I went ahead and began coding prototypes. This is where all the exciting stuff happens. Jake received regular updates to a live clickable prototype and I continually received feedback. At this point we worked through a number of iterations, changing and playing around with the design.

                <p class="margin-none-t">
                  The Sense website then went through a final stage where I optimized it for usage with a custom CMS. At this point the site also went through more iterations in order to improve its performance and speed on all devices.

                <p class="margin-none-t">
                  The day came when the site was ready to launch and everything went off without a hitch. Jake and I got on Skype and I walked him through all the steps he had to take to re-point his domain.  I gave Jake a rundown of how to use his new CMS and that was it. The website can now be updated as easy as editing a Google doc.
