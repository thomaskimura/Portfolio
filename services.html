        <h3 class="margin-none text-big text-transform-uppercase text-family-default"><span class="border-solid-bottom">Web Design & Research</span></h3>
        <p>
          Your website is the first impression your brand will make on visitors. It is important that the design effectively represents your brand to create a great web experience. I create user-friendly designs in order to meet real business goals and objectives. By conducting user testing we ensure your website is optimized for its users and your objectives.
        </p>

        <h3 class="margin-none text-big text-transform-uppercase text-family-default"><span class="border-solid-bottom">Development & CMS</span></h3>
        <p>
          Working primarily with static site generators and existing platforms such as Shopify we bring your designs to life with customized performance driven responsive websites. Youâ€™ll be given both a flexible and easy to use dashboard where you can manage your entire site and add new pages without writing a single line of code.
        </p>

        <h3 class="margin-none text-big text-transform-uppercase text-family-default"><span class="border-solid-bottom">Logo & Branding</span></h3>
        <p>
          Our small team will work closely with you to bring your brand to life. I'll visualize your brand with a cohesive logo, colour palette and typographic guide.

        <h3 class="margin-none text-big text-transform-uppercase text-family-default"><span class="border-solid-bottom">Email Design</span></h3>
        <p>
          Email is not dead, it is cluttered with junk. As of now there are no real standards with hundreds of devices and email clients to design for. This makes it very tricky to design consistent and functional email campaigns. I'll make sure your email campaigns look great on all devices while also staying out of the junk folder.
        </p>

        <h3 class="margin-none text-big text-transform-uppercase text-family-default"><span class="border-solid-bottom">Ecommerce Design</span></h3>
        <p>
          Working closely with the Shopify platform I can create a customized ecommerce website that converts on any device. I'll walk you through everything you need to familiarize yourself with the admin panel. You'll be selling your goods in no time!

        <p>
          SEO is one of the many ways to drive traffic to a website. However, without implementing SEO techniques a website will be losing potential organic leads. We'll help make sure your content is formatted and optimized to be consumed by search engines and shared by humans. Without proper optimization your content is hidden from the internet.
