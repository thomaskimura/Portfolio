                <p class="margin-none">
                  Your website is the first impression your brand will make on visitors. It is important that the design effectively represents your brand to create a great web experience. My work has a strong emphasis on first—time users. I create user-friendly designs in order to meet real business goals and objectives. By conducting user testing I will ensure your website is optimized for its users and your objectives.

                <h3 class="opacity-2 margin-none-b margin-t2">Development & CMS</h3>
                <p class="margin-none">
                  Design is only part of the battle. It is critical that designs are developed into a final refined product. Working primarily with static site generators I produce customized performance driven websites and implement them using a super simple CMS. You’ll be given both a flexible and easy to use dashboard where you can manage your entire site and add new pages without writing a single line of code.

                <p class="margin-none">
                  SEO is one of the many ways to drive traffic to a website. However, without implementing SEO techniques a website will be losing potential organic leads. I will help make sure your content is formatted and optimized to be consumed by search engines and shared by humans. Without proper optimization your content is hidden from the internet.

                <h3 class="opacity-2 margin-none-b margin-t2">Hosting</h3>
                <p class="margin-none">
                  Using a safe, secure and reliable network is extremely important to ensure your website is easily available to users when they want it. To meet these needs your website will be hosted with AWS and advance performance enhancement techniques will be used. Basically, your website will be fast, reliable and secure.

                <h3 class="opacity-2 margin-none-b margin-t2">Email Design</h3>
                <p class="margin-none">
                  Email is not dead, it is cluttered with junk. As of now there are no real standards and hundreds of devices and email clients to design for, this makes it very tricky to design consistent and functional email campaigns. I'll make sure your email campaigns look great on all devices while also staying out of the junk folder.
