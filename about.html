            I value people over profits, quality over quantity & believe design does not have to be at the expense of functionality.

        <h3 class="margin-none opacity-3">Fearless</h3>
        <p class="margin-none-t">
          I can’t say I’m completely fearless, but I like to venture into unknown ground. I like to learn new things and face challenges head on.
        </p>
        <h3 class="margin-none opacity-3">Quality</h3>
        <p class="margin-none-t">
          Quality is at the core of everything I do. To be quite honest, my obsession with perfection is immense. I tend to take on a smaller number of projects at a time, this way I can focus all my energy on what matters.

      <div class="large-4 medium-4 small-12 columns">
        <h3 class="margin-none opacity-3">Transparency</h3>
        <p class="margin-none-t">
          I value transparency. Relationships with people are important and I truly want to add value to the people I work with. I’m authentic and
          100% human.
        </p>
        <h3 class="margin-none opacity-3">Keep it Simple</h3>
        <p class="margin-none-t">
          Theres no need to over complete things. I believe the simplest solution and answer is often the best. Simple solutions are clear and they are easy to understand.

          Life is a struggle. Oddly enough this is what makes life so interesting and I wouldn't want it any other way. The best part is climbing the mountain not looking down from the peak.
