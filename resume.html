          I started at Student CarShare in May 2014 as an intern and quickly became an important part of the team. Working in a small team allowed
          me to learn a lot... and fast. At Student CarShare I played many roles, designer, developer, marketer. I've worked with email marketing,
          social media, digital ads, events, website optimization. However, my role at Student CarShare has always been focused on one key thing,
          growth. While at Student CarShare memberships generated through web efforts <strong>increased by 973% over a one-year period</strong> from July 1,
          2014 to July 1, 2015.
