      <h3 class="opacity-2"><span class="border-solid-bottom">FAQS</span></h3>

      <h4 class="opacity-2 margin-none">Why are you doing this for free?</h4>
      <p>
        Once your free Shopify ecommerce store is setup you'll pay Shopify a monthly fee based on the <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/pricing" target="_blank">plan</a> you choose. From this monthly fee we're paid a commission from Shopify. We get paid and you get a Shopify ecommerce store setup for free.
      </p>

      <h4 class="opacity-2 margin-none">Can my store look a certain way?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes. You'll have the opportunity to tell us exactly what you want. You can show us examples and give us a detailed breakdown to follow. We'll tell you what's possible and what would not be covered under our free setups.
      </p>

      <h4 class="opacity-2 margin-none">Can I request changes and additional revisions?</h4>
      <p>
        Our free Shopify setup includes unlimited revisions while in development. Customizations that are not covered by our free setup service will be charged at $65/hr.
